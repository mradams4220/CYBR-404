One thing I learned from the career center presentation is that I should do extensive research on the companies I plan on talking to at the career fairs because then I will know where they are from what kind of internships they are offering and the basic things about their company. Also, one thing I found out I need to work on from this presentation is that I need to work on being able to keep a constructive conversation with the employers that I am talking to.
